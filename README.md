#### <ins>Background:</ins>
Oil futures prices are time series data.  Each business day, there is one settlement price for the commodity.  The commodity illustrated in the model is Brent Crude, the key global price benchmark for Atlantic basin crude.  [Brent]( https://www.theice.com/products/219/Brent-Crude-Futures/specs)  is used to price the majority of Earth's internationally-traded crude supplies.

#### <ins>The Model:</ins>
My statistical seasonality model selects the best trades using historical data.  Then, cumulative trade Profit/Loss performance is tallied for the designated time period.  Model logic is built on Python and Pandas.  The Model reads and writes data from the SQLite3 database named **data.sqlite**.  Data visualizations are plotted with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

We can run the model on a different commodity like West Texas Intermediate (WTI) or RBOB Gasoline Futures.  We just need appropriate data in a SQLite database!

*Please note:  Certain code is omitted from the model.  Full model is available upon request.*

#### <ins>Terminology:</ins>
* **Fit Years** - Years used in computing trade ranking stats.
* **Initial Price** - Price on Day before first day of month.
* **Last Price** - Last Price for day.
* **Roll Day** - Last day position is held.  For example, this may be a few days in advance of the expiration date.
* **Capital** - Position profit/loss.
* **Contract Month** - The month in which seller must deliver.  Ex. Delivery of one May-2019 Brent contract is physical delivery of 1,000 barrels of Brent in May.  The Ice Brent contract has the option to be cash settled.
* **Long Spread** - long front contract, short back contract.
* **Short Spread** - Short front contract, long back contract.
* **Front month** - first month in a spread.  Ex. 1 in a 1v3 spread.
* **Back month** - last  month in a spread.  Ex. 3 in a 1v3 spread.
* **calmonth_spread_label** - spread contract month with front and back contract.  Ex 1-3v6 is contract month 1 (Jan).  Front contract is month 3 (Mar) and back contract is month 6 (Jun).  The spread is the front price minus the back price.  That is the March minus June settlement price in this case.
* **z_diff** - z-score change between the month-start and month-end z-scores
* **Settles TABLE:** - settle - Daily settlement price of product
* **Spreads TABLE:** - spread - Settlement price difference for two different valid Contact Months on the same date.
* **Expiry TABLE:** - last_trade_date - the last day the Contract Month (prompt_month) is available.  Ex. BRENT future for May-2019  expired 03-29-2019.
