#### <ins>Background:</ins>
Oil futures prices are time series data.  Each business day, there is one settlement price for the commodity.  The commodity illustrated in the model is Brent Crude, the key global price benchmark for Atlantic basin crude.  [Brent]( https://www.theice.com/products/219/Brent-Crude-Futures/specs)  is used to price the majority of Earth's internationally-traded crude supplies.

We can run the model on a different commodity like West Texas Intermediate (WTI) or RBOB Gasoline Futures.  We just need the data in a SQLite database!

#### <ins>The Model:</ins>
My statistical seasonality model selects the best trades using historical data.  Trade Profit/Loss performance is tallied for the adjacent period.  Model logic is built using Python and Pandas.  Model reads and writes data from a SQLite3 database.  Model data visualizations use Seaborn and Matplotlib.
